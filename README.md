This is a tool intended for generating a excel spreadsheet, containing data from Jira tickets, filtering by a range of dates and criteria. This is designed for use with the Oracle Jira, but should be usable for other Jira Boards. (It may need some modification)
It communicates with the Jira API and filters out the JSON it receives back to grab relevant info. It then organizes the information it gathers into rows and columns in a spreadsheet. The criteria the program filters by may be modified with the GUI, including the URL endpoint, the assignee of the tickets, the type of tickets, the organization, and more.
