# Support Excel Automation Tool #
### (Jira To Excel) ###
## General Overview ##
This is a tool intended for generating a excel spreadsheet, containing data from Jira tickets, filtering by a range of dates and criteria. This is designed for use with the Oracle Jira, but should be usable for other Jira Boards. (It may need some modification)

## How can I use it? ##
The first test versions will be available for download soon at the latest releases section.

## How does it work? ##
It communicates with the Jira API and filters out the JSON it receives back to grab relevant info. It then organizes the information it gathers into rows and columns in a spreadsheet. The criteria the program filters by may be modified with the UI, including the URL endpoint, the assignee of the tickets, the type of tickets, the organization, and more.

## Can I modify it? ##
Absolutely! Just fork the repo and leave credit.
